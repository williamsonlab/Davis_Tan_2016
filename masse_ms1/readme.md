###This version of masse is used with outputs from massacre (_iso.csv) - it allows for automated filtering of MS1 datasets
###It will require the additional libraries, qMS, qMSDefs, vizLib, and mrmTools
###preprocess.py can be used to process a bunch of iso_csv files without having to open each one individually in masse
###mergeIsoCsvs.py can be used to merge a bunch of iso_csv files into a single file to be used by masseESIGroup, which allows for filtering across multiple injections.
